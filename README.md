# Cartoonified

This project aims to convert regular images into cartoon-like representations using image processing techniques.The project uses Cv2, matplotlib, and numpy to convert an image into its cartoonised image. 

It is done by creating edge mask of the image and creating a blurred version of the image. Then, superimposition the two image obtained before.

To reduce noise from a blurred image, Bilateral filter is used which is one of the prominent filter technique.
